# Snake
Classical snake game by my design. I combined different types of snake game into my version. It includes 3 different difficulty levels, varied by snake's speed change and obstacles on map. 
Additionally I created 4 gateways on each side of the map, through which the snake can pass to the parallel gate. Application consists of 4 different screens: main menu, mode selection & entering nick, highscore list and game itself.
The best 10 scores are kept saved in a file.

## Dependencies
